## 🏗️ Architecture & Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application uses vanilla JavaScript for maximum performance and minimal dependencies. The Socket.IO client manages WebSocket connections, while the DOM manipulation handles the user interface updates in real-time.

### Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js for HTTP endpoints and Socket.IO for WebSocket management. User sessions are maintained in memory with proper cleanup on disconnection. The architecture supports horizontal scaling with Redis adapter for multiple server instances.

### Real-Time Communication Flow
1. User authentication and validation
2. WebSocket connection establishment
3. User state synchronization across all clients
4. Message broadcasting to connected users
5. Connection status monitoring and cleanup

## 📊 Performance & Scalability

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for fast loading
- **Efficient**: Event-driven architecture for optimal resource usage
- **Scalable**: Ready for horizontal scaling with Redis adapter
- **Responsive**: Sub-100ms message delivery in optimal conditions
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### Customization Options
- **Styling**: Modify `src/style.css` for custom themes
- **Features**: Extend `src/main.js` for additional functionality
- **Server Logic**: Enhance `server/index.js` for advanced features

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Deployment Options

**Heroku**
```bash
echo "web: node server/index.js" > Procfile
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

**Railway/Render/DigitalOcean**
- Build Command: `npm install && cd server && npm install`
- Start Command: `node server/index.js`

**Docker**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && cd server && npm install
EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["node", "server/index.js"]
```

## 🔍 API Documentation

### WebSocket Events

**Client to Server:**
